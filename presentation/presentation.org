* Overview
  Order of execution:

  1. BIOS
  2. BOOTLOADER
  3. KERNEL
  4. COMMANDS
* BIOS
  - Basic Input/Output System
  - Code is inside the Motherboard's chip
  - Runs in 16-bit Real Mode
  - Verifies magic number in the bootable HDD's first sector
  - Loads first sector to 0x00000000 in memory
  - Jump to first command
* BOOTLOADER
  - The first sector in the HDD
  - Written in 16-bit and 32-bit assembly
  - Moves from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode
  - Loads up the kernel image from disk to memory 0x00001000
  - Jumps to kernel's kmain() function

* KERNEL
  The main module of the OS
** IRQs
   Kernel sets up IRQ (interrupt request) handlers for any hardware signals which interrupt CPU execution (keyboard, timer, etc.)
** Drivers
   | Name         | Description                      |
   |--------------+----------------------------------|
   | KEYBOARD     | Detect key-presses               |
   | CMOS         | Timer                            |
   | VGA          | Print ASCII characters to screen |
   | HD           | Interact with main hard-drive    |
** Libraries
   | File     | Description                                          |
   |----------+------------------------------------------------------|
   | fs       | Interact with file-system                            |
   | memory   | Memory functions, dynamic memory allocation (bitmap) |
   | string   | String functions, string manipulation                |
   | integers | Integer functions                                    |
   | print    | Print strings, string format                         |
** FS INODES TABLE
   File system descriptor table consists of many INODEs, which each is a file representation
*** INODE Example
   | Name       | Size | Description                                  |
   |------------+------+----------------------------------------------|
   | type       |    4 | item type (file/dir)                         |
   | size       |    4 | item's content size                          |
   | blocks     |    8 | array of block pointers to sectors in the HD |
   | num        |    4 | item index in table                          |
   | father_num |    4 | item's parent index                          |
   | name       |    8 | item's name                                  |
   NOTE: Most attributes aren't in use currently, as no commands require their use
** Load Sequence
   1. Clear screen
   2. Init CMOS: get initial time values
   3. Install ISR: make sure different CPU IRQs are answered (e.g. div. by 0)
   4. Install IRQs: install IRQ handlers for keyboard & CMOS
   5. Show statusbar
   6. Verify HD
   7. Verify FS
   8. Wait for system password unlock (if pass exists)
   9. Execute user commands
* COMMANDS
  Shell handler parses command and its arguments and calls to the correct command handler
